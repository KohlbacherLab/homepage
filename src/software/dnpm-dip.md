# DNPM:DIP

The Data Integration Platform (DIP) for the German Network of Personalized Medicine ([DNPM](https://dnpm.de/de)) allows to integrate the data from the Molecular Tumor Boards and Centers of Rare Diseases in order to perform queries on the federated data pool of all connected sites.

The DIP further acts as one of the clinical data nodes for the oncology and rare diseases use cases of the [Modellvorhaben Genomsequenzierung](https://www.bfarm.de/DE/Das-BfArM/Aufgaben/Modellvorhaben-Genomsequenzierung/_node.html).
