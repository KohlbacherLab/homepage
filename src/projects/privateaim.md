# PrivateAIM
PrivateAIM (Privacy-preserving Analytics in Medicine) is a leading initiative within Germany’s Medical Informatics Initiative
([MII](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/de/start)), dedicated to developing secure, scalable methods for analyzing
healthcare data while safeguarding patient privacy. By focusing on decentralized data processing, the FLAME (Federated Learning
and Analyses in MEdicine) platform ensures sensitive data remains protected, with only analysis algorithms and results exchanged.
Supported by 17 partner institutions, PrivateAIM is developing a platform for federated learning that integrates cutting-edge
privacy-preserving technologies. This collaboration aims to advance medical research, maintain high data security standards,
and improve
patient care outcomes. For more details, visit [PrivateAIM](https://privateaim.de/projekt.html) .
