Personalizing Oncology via Semantic Integration of Data\
Project Website: https://persons-project.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de

The central goal of the project is to develop a software system for providing homogeneous and intuitive access to all data relevant to therapeutic decisions. The project will enable clinicians to select stratified patient cohorts based on a full semantic integration of clinical and high-throughput (HT) data and to bring personalized tumor therapy to a new level through a touch-based visual analytics tool allowing intuitive access to all data – literally ‘information at your fingertips’. An interdisciplinary team, comprising experts from oncology, bioinformatics, clinical data management, cognitive sciences and UI-designer, works together to achieve these goals in order to optimize patient treatment.
