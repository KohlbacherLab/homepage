This project is one of the four consortia selected by the German Ministry of Education and Research for funding during the development and networking phase in the [Medical Informatics Initiative](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/start). It aims at providing data of comprehensive depth and breadth to physicians and to medical researchers. We will work on an acceleration of innovation, improved health care processes and decision support, resulting in tangible benefits for the patient.
