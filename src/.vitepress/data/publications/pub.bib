  abstract={Feature-based molecular networking (FBMN) is a popular analysis approach for liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry-based non-targeted metabolomics data. While processing liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry data through FBMN is fairly streamlined, downstream data handling and statistical interrogation are often a key bottleneck. Especially users new to statistical analysis struggle to effectively handle and analyze complex data matrices. Here we provide a comprehensive guide for the statistical analysis of FBMN results, focusing on the downstream analysis of the FBMN output table. We explain the data structure and principles of data cleanup and normalization, as well as uni- and multivariate statistical analysis of FBMN results. We provide explanations and code in two scripting languages (R and Python) as well as the QIIME2 framework for all protocol steps, from data clean-up to statistical analysis. All code is shared in the form of Jupyter Notebooks (https://github.com/Functional-Metabolomics-Lab/FBMN-STATS). Additionally, the protocol is accompanied by a web application with a graphical user interface (https://fbmn-statsguide.gnps2.org/) to lower the barrier of entry for new users and for educational purposes. Finally, we also show users how to integrate their statistical results into the molecular network using the Cytoscape visualization tool. Throughout the protocol, we use a previously published environmental metabolomics dataset for demonstration purposes. Together, the protocol, code and web application provide a complete guide and toolbox for FBMN data integration, cleanup and advanced statistical analysis, enabling new users to uncover molecular insights from their non-targeted metabolomics data. Our protocol is tailored for the seamless analysis of FBMN results from Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking and can be easily adapted to other mass spectrometry feature detection, annotation and networking tools.},

While significant advancements have been made in TDP in sample preparation, separation, instrumentation, and data analysis, reliable and reproducible data analysis still remains one of the major bottlenecks in TDP. A key step for robust data analysis is the establishment of an objective estimation of proteoform-level false discovery rate (FDR) in proteoform identification. The most widely used FDR estimation scheme is based on the target-decoy approach (TDA), which has primarily been established for BUP. We present evidence that the TDA-based FDR estimation may not work at the proteoform-level due to an overlooked factor, namely the erroneous deconvolution of precursor masses, which leads to incorrect FDR estimation. We argue that the conventional TDA-based FDR in proteoform identification is in fact protein-level FDR rather than proteoform-level FDR unless precursor deconvolution error rate is taken into account. To address this issue, we propose a formula to correct for proteoform-level FDR bias by combining TDA-based FDR and precursor deconvolution error rate.},

UmetaFlow is implemented as a Snakemake workflow, making it easy to use, scalable, and reproducible. For more interactive computing, visualization, as well as development, the workflow is also implemented in Jupyter notebooks using the Python programming language and a set of Python bindings to the OpenMS algorithms (pyOpenMS). Finally, UmetaFlow is also offered as a web-based Graphical User Interface for parameter optimization and processing of smaller-sized datasets. UmetaFlow was validated with in-house LC–MS/MS datasets of actinomycetes producing known secondary metabolites, as well as commercial standards, and it detected all expected features and accurately annotated 76% of the molecular formulas and 65% of the structures. As a more generic validation, the publicly available MTBLS733 and MTBLS736 datasets were used for benchmarking, and UmetaFlow detected more than 90% of all ground truth features and performed exceptionally well in quantification and discriminating marker selection. We anticipate that UmetaFlow will provide a useful platform for the interpretation of large metabolomics datasets.},

Selection of the optimal therapy relies on a complex interdisciplinary analysis and interpretation of these variants by experts in molecular tumor boards. With up to hundreds of somatic variants identified in a tumor, this process requires visual analytics tools to guide and accelerate the annotation process.

Results: The Personal Cancer Network Explorer (PeCaX) is a visual analytics tool supporting the efficient annotation, navigation, and interpretation of somatic genomic variants through functional annotation, drug target annotation, and visual interpretation within the context of biological networks. Starting with somatic variants in a VCF file, PeCaX enables users to explore these variants through a web-based graphical user interface. The most protruding feature of PeCaX is the combination of clinical variant annotation and gene-drug networks with an interactive visualization. This reduces the time and effort the user needs to invest to get to a treatment suggestion and helps to generate new hypotheses. PeCaX is being provided as a platform-independent containerized software package for local or institution-wide deployment. PeCaX is available for download at https://github.com/KohlbacherLab/PeCaX-docker .

Here, we present FLASHIda, an intelligent online data acquisition algorithm for TDP that ensures the real-time selection of high-quality precursors of diverse proteoforms. FLASHIda combines fast charge deconvolution algorithms and machine learning-based quality assessment for optimal precursor selection. In an analysis of E. coli lysate, FLASHIda increases the number of unique proteoform level identifications from 800 to 1500 or generates a near-identical number of identifications in one third of the instrument time when compared to standard DDA mode. Furthermore, FLASHIda enables sensitive mapping of post-translational modifications and detection of chemical adducts. As a software extension module to the instrument, FLASHIda can be readily adopted for TDP studies of complex samples to enhance proteoform identification rates.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: With a growing amount of (multi-)omics data being
 available, the extraction of knowledge from these datasets is
 still a difficult problem. Classical enrichment-style analyses
 require predefined pathways or gene sets that are tested for
 significant deregulation to assess whether the pathway is
 functionally involved in the biological process under study. De
 novo identification of these pathways can reduce the bias
 inherent in predefined pathways or gene sets. At the same time,
 the definition and efficient identification of these pathways de
 novo from large biological networks is a challenging problem.
 RESULTS: We present a novel algorithm, DeRegNet, for the
 identification of maximally deregulated subnetworks on directed
 graphs based on deregulation scores derived from (multi-)omics
 data. DeRegNet can be interpreted as maximum likelihood
 estimation given a certain probabilistic model for de-novo
 subgraph identification. We use fractional integer programming
 to solve the resulting combinatorial optimization problem. We
 can show that the approach outperforms related algorithms on
 simulated data with known ground truths. On a publicly available
 liver cancer dataset we can show that DeRegNet can identify
 biologically meaningful subgraphs suitable for patient
 stratification. DeRegNet can also be used to find explicitly
 multi-omics subgraphs which we demonstrate by presenting
 subgraphs with consistent methylation-transcription patterns.
 DeRegNet is freely available as open-source software.
 CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithmic framework and its available
 implementation can serve as a valuable heuristic hypothesis
 generation tool contextualizing omics data within biomolecular
 networks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stroke is one of the most frequent diseases, and half
 of the stroke survivors are left with permanent impairment.
 Prediction of individual outcome is still difficult. Many but not
 all patients with stroke improve by approximately 1.7 times the
 initial impairment, that has been termed proportional recovery
 rule. The present study aims at identifying factors predicting
 motor outcome after stroke more accurately than before, and
 observe associations of rehabilitation treatment with outcome.
 METHODS: The study is designed as a multi-centre prospective
 clinical observational trial. An extensive primary data set of
 clinical, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, and laboratory data
 will be collected within 96 h of stroke onset from patients with
 relevant upper extremity deficit, as indexed by a
 Fugl-Meyer-Upper Extremity (FM-UE) score $łeq$ 50. At least 200
 patients will be recruited. Clinical scores will include the
 FM-UE score (range 0-66, unimpaired function is indicated by a
 score of 66), Action Research Arm Test, modified Rankin Scale,
 Barthel Index and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale.
 Follow-up clinical scores and applied types and amount of
 rehabilitation treatment will be documented in the rehabilitation
 hospitals. Final follow-up clinical scoring will be performed 90
 days after the stroke event. The primary endpoint is the change
 in FM-UE defined as 90 days FM-UE minus initial FM-UE, divided by
 initial FM-UE impairment. Changes in the other clinical scores
 serve as secondary endpoints. Machine learning methods will be
 employed to analyze the data and predict primary and secondary
 endpoints based on the primary data set and the different
 rehabilitation treatments. DISCUSSION: If successful, outcome and
 relation to rehabilitation treatment in patients with acute motor
 stroke will be predictable more reliably than currently possible,
 leading to personalized neurorehabilitation. An important
 regulatory aspect of this trial is the first-time implementation
 of systematic patient data transfer between emergency and
 rehabilitation hospitals, which are divided institutions in
 Germany. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered at
 ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04688970 ) on 30 December 2020.},

abstract = {To identify potential genetic causes for Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser syndrome (MRKH), we analyzed blood and rudimentary uterine tissue of 5 MRKH discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Assuming that a variant solely identified in the affected twin or affected tissue could cause the phenotype, we identified a mosaic variant in ACTR3B with high allele frequency in the affected tissue, low allele frequency in the blood of the affected twin, and almost absent in blood of the unaffected twin. Focusing on MRKH candidate genes, we detected a pathogenic variant in GREB1L in one twin pair and their unaffected mother showing a reduced phenotypic penetrance. Furthermore, two variants of unknown clinical significance in PAX8 and WNT9B were identified. In addition, we conducted transcriptome analysis of affected tissue and observed perturbations largely similar to those in sporadic cases. These shared transcriptional changes were enriched for terms associated with estrogen and its receptors pointing at a role of estrogen in MRKH pathology. Our genome sequencing approach of blood and uterine tissue of discordant twins is the most extensive study performed on twins discordant for MRKH so far. As no clear pathogenic differences were detected, research to evaluate other regulatory layers are required to better understand the complex etiology of MRKH.},

The main advantages include greater reproducibility and sensitivity and a greater dynamic range compared with data-dependent acquisition (DDA). However, the data analysis is complex and often requires expert knowledge when dealing with large-scale data sets. Here we present DIAproteomics, a multifunctional, automated, high-throughput pipeline implemented in the Nextflow workflow management system that allows one to easily process proteomics and peptidomics DIA data sets on diverse compute infrastructures. The central components are well-established tools such as the OpenSwathWorkflow for the DIA spectral library search and PyProphet for the false discovery rate assessment. In addition, it provides options to generate spectral libraries from existing DDA data and to carry out the retention time and chromatogram alignment. The output includes annotated tables and diagnostic visualizations from the statistical postprocessing and computation of fold-changes across pairwise conditions, predefined in an experimental design. DIAproteomics is well documented open-source software and is available under a permissive license to the scientific community at https://www.openms.de/diaproteomics/.},

In this regard, the 1346-1353 Yersinia pestis-caused Black Death pandemic, with continued plague outbreaks spanning several hundred years, is one of the most devastating recorded in human history. To investigate the potential impact of Y. pestis on human immunity genes we extracted DNA from 36 plague victims buried in a mass grave in Ellwangen, Germany in the 16th century. We targeted 488 immune-related genes, including HLA, using a novel in-solution hybridization capture approach. In comparison with 50 modern native inhabitants of Ellwangen, we find differences in allele frequencies for variants of the innate immunity proteins Ficolin-2 and NLRP14 at sites involved in determining specificity. We also observed that HLA-DRB1*13 is more than twice as frequent in the modern population, whereas HLA-B alleles encoding an isoleucine at position 80 (I-80+), HLA C*06:02 and HLA-DPB1 alleles encoding histidine at position 9 are half as frequent in the modern population. Simulations show that natural selection has likely driven these allele frequency changes. Thus, our data suggests that allele frequencies of HLA genes involved in innate and adaptive immunity responsible for extracellular and intracellular responses to pathogenic bacteria, such as Y. pestis, could have been affected by the historical epidemics that occurred in Europe.},

abstract = {Overcoming the COVID-19 crisis requires new ideas and strategies for online communication of personal medical information and patient empowerment. Rapid testing of a large number of subjects is essential to monitor, and delay, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to mitigate the pandemic's consequences. People not knowing that they are infected may not stay in quarantine and, thus, risk infecting others. Unfortunately, the massive number of COVID-19 tests performed is challenging for both laboratories and the units that take the throat swab and communicate the results. Reducing the communication burden for healthcare professionals. We developed a secure and easy-to-use tracking system to report COVID-19 test results online which is simple to understand for the tested subjects as soon as these results become available. Instead of personal calls, the system updates the status and the results of the tests automatically. This aims to reduce the delay when informing testees about their results and, consequently, to slow down the virus spread. The application draws on an existing tracking tool. With this open-source and browser-based online tracking system, we aim to minimize the time required to inform the tested person and the test units, e.g. hospitals or the public healthcare system. The system can be integrated into the clinical workflow with very modest effort and avoids excessive load to telephone hotlines. The test status and results are published on a secured web-page enabling regular status checks by patients not using smartphones, which has some importance as smartphone usage diminishes with age. Stress tests and statistics show the performance of our software. CTest is currently running at two University Hospitals (Ulm, Tübingen; Germany) with thousands of tests each week. Results show a mean number of 10 views per testee. CTest runs independent of existing infrastructures, aims at straight-forward integration, and safe transmission of information. The system is easy-to-use for testees. QR Code links allow for quick accession to the test results. The mean number of views per entry indicates the reduced amount of time for both, healthcare professionals and testees. The system is quite generic and can be extended and adapted to other communication tasks.},

Recently, sequence coevolution-based approaches have led to a breakthrough in predicting monomer protein structures and protein interaction interfaces. Here we address the challenges of large-scale interaction prediction at residue resolution with a fast alignment concatenation method and a probabilistic score for the interaction of residues. Importantly, this method (EVcomplex2) is able to assess the likelihood of a protein interaction, as we show here applied to large-scale experimental datasets where the pairwise interactions are unknown. We predict 504 interactions de novo in the E. coli membrane proteome, including 243 that are newly discovered. While EVcomplex2 does not require available structures, coevolving residue pairs can be used to produce structural models of protein interactions, as done here for membrane complexes including the Flagellar Hook-Filament Junction and the Tol/Pal complex.

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has caused strains on health systems worldwide disrupting routine hospital services for all non-COVID patients. Within this retrospective study, we analyzed inpatient hospital admissions across 18 German university hospitals during the 2020 lockdown period compared to 2018. Patients admitted to hospital between January 1 and May 31, 2020 and the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019 were included in this study. Data derived from electronic health records were collected and analyzed using the data integration center infrastructure implemented in the university hospitals that are part of the four consortia funded by the German Medical Informatics Initiative. Admissions were grouped and counted by ICD 10 chapters and specific reasons for treatment at each site. Pooled aggregated data were centrally analyzed with descriptive statistics to compare absolute and relative differences between time periods of different years. The results illustrate how care process adoptions depended on the COVID-19 epidemiological situation and the criticality of the disease. Overall inpatient hospital admissions decreased by 35% in weeks 1 to 4 and by 30.3% in weeks 5 to 8 after the lockdown announcement compared to 2018. Even hospital admissions for critical care conditions such as malignant cancer treatments were reduced. We also noted a high reduction of emergency admissions such as myocardial infarction (38.7%), whereas the reduction in stroke admissions was smaller (19.6%). In contrast, we observed a considerable reduction in admissions for non-critical clinical situations, such as hysterectomies for benign tumors (78.8%) and hip replacements due to arthrosis (82.4%). In summary, our study shows that the university hospital admission rates in Germany were substantially reduced following the national COVID-19 lockdown. These included critical care or emergency conditions in which deferral is expected to impair clinical outcomes. Future studies are needed to delineate how appropriate medical care of critically ill patients can be maintained during a pandemic.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was the prediction of the geographical origin of almonds (Prunus dulcis Mill.) via Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy. For this purpose, 250 almond samples from six different countries were analyzed. As the year of harvest has a major impact on the metabolome, three different crop years (2017–2019) were considered. In order to predict the geographical origin, a support vector machine (SVM) model was trained. The SVM achieved a mean classification accuracy of 80.3% (± 1.5%). In particular one of the economically relevant questions – the distinction between Mediterranean almonds and American almonds – can be answered with this model. Combining the Spanish and Italian almonds to one Mediterranean class the overall classification accuracy is increased to up to 88.2% ± 1.0%. These results confirmed the suitability of NIR screening for the determination of the geographical origin of almonds and may pave the way for future analytical applications.

With regard to potential future applications, the transferability of the developed NIR method to blanched almonds was discussed and evaluated: Even if the classification accuracy of unblanched almonds is higher than the prediction based on blanched almonds, the determination of the geographical origin still seems to be possible with this type of processed almonds.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is currently leading to
 increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients all over the world.
 Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory
 tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress
 syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a
 dysregulated immune system in the severe cases call for a better
 characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune
 system. METHODS: In order to dissect COVID-19-driven immune host
 responses, we performed RNA-seq of whole blood cell
 transcriptomes and granulocyte preparations from mild and severe
 COVID-19 patients and analyzed the data using a combination of
 conventional and data-driven co-expression analysis.
 Additionally, publicly available data was used to show the
 distinction from COVID-19 to other diseases. Reverse drug target
 prediction was used to identify known or novel drug candidates
 based on finding from data-driven findings. RESULTS: Here, we
 profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 COVID-19 patients and
 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on
 molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures
 were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was
 corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent
 second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a
 third cohort of 16 COVID-19 patients (44 samples). Comparison of
 COVID-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over
 3100 samples derived from 12 different viral infections,
 inflammatory diseases, and independent control samples revealed
 highly specific transcriptome signatures for COVID-19. Further,
 stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific
 drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune
 response of the host. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides novel
 insights in the distinct molecular subgroups or phenotypes that
 are not simply explained by clinical parameters. We show that
 whole blood transcriptomes are extremely informative for COVID-19
 since they capture granulocytes which are major drivers of
 disease severity.},

On this held-out dataset, our baselines reach depending on the specific entity types F1-scores of 0.72-0.90 for named entity recognition, 0.10-0.68 for entity normalization, 0.55 for negation detection, and 0.33 for speculation detection. Medical corpus annotation is a complex and time-consuming task. This makes sharing of such resources even more important. To our knowledge, BRONCO is the first sizable and freely available German medical corpus. Our baseline results show that more research efforts are necessary to lift the quality of information extraction in German medical texts to the level already possible for English.},

We implement MAGE-TAB-Proteomics in a crowdsourcing project to manually curate over 200 public datasets. We also describe tools and libraries to validate and submit sample metadata-related information to the PRIDE repository. We expect that these developments will improve the reproducibility and facilitate the reanalysis and integration of public proteomics datasets.},

Support vector classification of the geographical origin achieved an accuracy of 91.5% for the entire sample set and 87.8% after undersampling the majority class. Important regions of the spectra could be identified and assigned to potential chemical markers. A subset of samples was compared to isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), an established method for the determination of origin of white asparagus in Germany. Here, SVM classification led to accuracies of 79.4% for NMR and 70.9% for IRMS. Finally, the classification of asparagus from different German regions was evaluated, and the influence of year and variety was analyzed.},

abstract = {Background

The conventional method for the diagnosis of malaria parasites is the microscopic examination of stained blood films, which is time consuming and requires expertise. We introduce computer-based image segmentation and life stage classification with a random forest classifier. Segmentation and stage classification are performed on a large dataset of malaria parasites with ground truth labels provided by experts.
Methods

We made use of Giemsa stained images obtained from the blood of 16 patients infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Experts labeled the parasite types from each of the images. We applied a two-step approach: image segmentation followed by life stage classification. In segmentation, we classified each pixel as a parasite or non-parasite pixel using a random forest classifier. Performance was evaluated with classification accuracy, Dice coefficient and free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) analysis. In life stage classification, we classified each of the segmented objects into one of 8 classes: 6 parasite life stages, early ring, late ring or early trophozoite, mid trophozoite, early schizont, late schizont or segmented, and two other classes, white blood cell or debris.
Results

Our segmentation method gives an average cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.82 which is a 13% improvement compared to the Otsu method. The Otsu method achieved a True Positive Fraction (TPF) of 0.925 at the expense of a False Positive Rate (FPR) of 2.45. At the same TPF of 0.925, our method achieved an FPR of 0.92, an improvement by more than a factor two. We find that inclusion of average intensity of the whole image as feature for the random forest considerably improves segmentation performance. We obtain an overall accuracy of 58.8% when classifying all life stages. Stages are mostly confused with their neighboring stages. When we reduce the life stages to ring, trophozoite and schizont only, we obtain an accuracy of 82.7%.
Conclusion

Pixel classification gives better segmentation performance than the conventional Otsu method. Effects of staining and background variations can be reduced with the inclusion of average intensity features. The proposed method and data set can be used in the development of automatic tools for the detection and stage classification of malaria parasites. The data set is publicly available as a benchmark for future studies.},

abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild to moderate respiratory tract infection, however, a subset of patients progress to severe disease and respiratory failure. The mechanism of protective immunity in mild forms and the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 associated with increased neutrophil counts and dysregulated immune responses remain unclear. In a dual-center, two-cohort study, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of whole-blood and peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to determine changes in immune cell composition and activation in mild versus severe COVID-19 (242 samples from 109 individuals) over time. HLA-DRhiCD11chi inflammatory monocytes with an interferon-stimulated gene signature were elevated in mild COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was marked by occurrence of neutrophil precursors, as evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DRlo monocytes. Our study provides detailed insights into the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and reveals profound alterations in the myeloid cell compartment associated with severe COVID-19.},
