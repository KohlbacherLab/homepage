# KohlbacherLab

Founded in 2000, the Kohlbacher lab is made up of two groups:
- **Applied Bioinformatics (ABI)** at the University T端bingen
- **Translational Bioinformatics (TBI)** at the University Hospital T端bingen

## ABI
The ABI at the [University](https://www.uni-tuebingen.de/) of T端bingen specializes in the analysis of
omics data (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics), structural bioinformatics, and computational immunomics.

The Kohlbacher lab thrives on collaboration, working closely with experimental labs to develop and apply innovative methods and algorithms to tackle complex challenges in the life sciences.
It has a well-earned reputation for its contributions to the field, particularly in the development of high-quality research software.

## TBI

The TBI group at the University Hospital T端bingen operates at the intersection of medical informatics and bioinformatics.
As a vital member of the DIFUTURE consortium, the group is dedicated to developing and establishing Data Integration Centers as part of the German Medical Informatics Initiative.
