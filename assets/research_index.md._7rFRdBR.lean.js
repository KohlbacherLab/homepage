By integrating molecular data (bioinformatics) and healthcare data (medical informatics), it becomes possible to identify identify new pathomechanisms, suggest personalized therapies, or enable machine learning on medical data. Current projects include the development of infrastructures and methods to enable molecular tumor boards and new methods for distributed, privacy-preserving data analytics.</p><p>More on our current projects can be found here.</p>',17)]))}const h=a(r,[["render",n]]);export{p as __pageData,h as default};
